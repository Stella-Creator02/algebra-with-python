This project contains my first set of Python functions created in Google Colab.  
I learned how to define functions, use parameters, and return values to solve math problems like area, perimeter, percentages, and even prime numbers!  

The hardest function for me was the **Pythagorean Theorem** because it involved square roots, but once I understood the formula, it became clear.  

This is the beginning of my coding portfolio, and Iâ€™m excited to keep building more projects with Python!
